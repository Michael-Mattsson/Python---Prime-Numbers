Prime Numbers Project

This project focuses on working with prime numbers in Python. It consists of two main parts:

Prime Number Identification: This part of the project involves creating a function to determine whether a given input number is a prime number or not. The function employs various techniques to efficiently identify prime numbers, contributing to a deeper understanding of prime number generation algorithms.

Counting Prime Numbers in a Range: The second part of the project involves counting the number of prime numbers within a specified range. By implementing this functionality, the project provides insights into prime number distribution and density within different numerical intervals.

Origin of the Project

The assignment for this project was discovered on 365 Data Science, a platform dedicated to providing comprehensive learning resources in the field of data science. However, I chose to develop my own version of the solutions using Python, incorporating my unique approach and insights.

Features

Prime Number Identification: Develops a function to efficiently determine whether a given number is prime or not.
Counting Prime Numbers: Implements functionality to count the prime numbers within a specified numerical range.
Explanatory Comments: Throughout the code, explanatory comments are included to elucidate the thought process and logic behind the implementation decisions.
How to Use
To utilize this project, simply clone the repository and explore the Python scripts provided. Feel free to copy and adapt the code for your own projects. While there are various ways to approach prime number-related tasks, I encourage you to give credit where due if you find this code useful.

Acknowledgements

I would like to express gratitude to 365 Data Science for providing the initial inspiration for this project. Additionally, I appreciate the support and resources provided by the FlowStack community, which enabled me to refine and develop my own version of the solutions.
